# DDS_CASE_STUDY2
The DDS Case Study required the generation of Attrition and Salary Prediction models.  Provided sample data was used for generation of training and test data sets.  In total of three knn models were built, with the final solution using an over sample technique to produce an enriched Attrition level for better model tuning.  Salary Model yielded a very robust MLR model once co-linear and unless variables were removed.  Upon completion of model tuning, each model was used to generate prediction set blinded data.  The quality and accuracy of these predictions are a direct representations of each models efficacy.
